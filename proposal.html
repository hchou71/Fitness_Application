      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        In current times where there is a strong sense of the importance of keeping a healthy lifestyle, we believe that
        people may not have the right resources to know how to begin. Our team would like to address the issues of
        people not knowing where to start working out, not having the knowledge of various exercises they can do, and
        not having a platform where they can track and share their progress. A majority of circulating fitness
        information today comes from fitness YouTubers and well-known fitness articles. Because of this, it is mostly
        the same general information with little variety. These influencers are all well into their fitness journeys,
        and their experiences with what works best might not necessarily work for everyone. We want gym goers and people
        that workout at home to be able to get advice and connect with others with the same needs. An example of an
        attempt to target our problem space would be the <a
          href="https://central.gymshark.com/article/the-gymshark-training-app-for-ios-and-android"
          target="_blank">GymShark fitness mobile application</a>. Although GymShark does provide various exercises to
        their users from certified trainers, there is no feature where users can interact with each other by sharing
        exercises they enjoyed. Additionally, GymShark only allows certified trainers to upload exercises, rather than
        users and trainers.

      <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
      <p>
        Our app intends to target people who want or need suggestions on working out/fitness. They can be beginners or
        experienced. Trainers might be able to use this application to perform the schedule or introduce different
        exercises to their students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expected features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can upload their own exercise images with explanations as a way to get beginners started.
          <ol>-Users can also comment under these exercise posts.</ol>
          <ol>-Users can also save user posted workouts to view later.</ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Search and filter functionality so users can search for exercises for the muscle group they want to target
          that day.
          <ol>-We are considering it being a map of a human body that users can select different muscles they want to
            target.</ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Online forum where people can post fitness questions and start online discussions of various topics. Similar
          to a reddit page but specifically for health and fitness tips and discussions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can log their progress based on the number of sets and repetitions they complete and the weight they
          lifted.
          <ol>-Users will also be able to view their past workout logs to keep track of different workout progressions.
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> We will be using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joep89/weightlifting" target="_blank">this csv from
          kaggle</a> in order to organize exercises by the muscles that are being utilized.</p>
      <p>
        We will also want to use this <a href="https://wger.de/api/v2/?format=api" target="_blank">api</a> on fitness
        exercises if approved by Joel.
      </p>
      <p>Our platform will provide users with a feature to share their experiences so that we can foster a healthy
        environment where users of any experience level can find and share answers with each other. Our platform also
        provides preset workouts to view and try out, while also providing them with images or videos to show how to
        approach various exercises. Additionally, our platform will also provide users a function to look back at their
        previous workouts and to look at saved exercises they wanted to do at a later time. We believe that our platform
        will allow users to positively approach working out, regardless of their experience level, because we are
        providing a platform for health discussions amongst users, find new exercises they can try, and save and share
        various exercises they enjoy.</p>
