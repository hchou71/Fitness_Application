      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
          In current times where there is a strong sense of the importance of keeping a healthy lifestyle, we believe that people may not have the right resources to know how to begin. Our team would like to address the issues of people not knowing where to start working out, not having the knowledge of various exercises they can do, and not having a platform where they can track and share their progress. A majority of circulating fitness information today comes from fitness YouTubers and well-known fitness articles. Because of this, it is mostly the same general information with little variety. These influencers are all well into their fitness journeys, and their experiences with what works best might not necessarily work for everyone. We want gym goers and people that workout at home to be able to get advice and connect with others with the same needs. An example of an attempt to target our problem space would be the <a href="https://central.gymshark.com/article/the-gymshark-training-app-for-ios-and-android" target="_blank">GymShark fitness mobile application</a>. Although GymShark does provide various exercises to their users from certified trainers, there is no feature where users can interact with each other by sharing exercises they enjoyed. Additionally, GymShark only allows certified trainers to upload exercises, rather than users and trainers.
