# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

This project was created to help users interact with our platform during their health and fitness journey.
Our platform allows users to search for new workouts, log their workouts, view past workouts, and chat with
fellow users.
